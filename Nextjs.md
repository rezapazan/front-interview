# Next.js Interview Questions

**1. What is Next.js & why use Next.js for web development?**
Next.js is a powerful React framework. It enables developers to build static and dynamic websites that are highly scalable. Next.js provides features like server-side rendering and static site generation. This framework gives you the best of both worlds: the SEO benefits of server-rendered applications with the performance of a single-page application.

**2. Explain SSR, CSR, SSG, ISR.**

- In Next.js, server-side rendering allows for the creation of dynamic pages with content that is fetched at request time. This means when a viewer loads a page, the content is pulled from the server, rendered into HTML, and then displayed. This process allows for pages to be unique to each request and can significantly improve performance for data-driven websites.

- Static Site Generation, or SSG, differs from SSR as it builds the pages at build time. This process renders pages into static HTML files that are readily available to serve on request. SSG is excellent for sites with content that does not change often
